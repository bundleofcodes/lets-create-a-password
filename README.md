# lets-create-a-password

## Description

- I created a password generator for the user to be able to have a password generated with ease. It allows the user to select the password length from 8-128 characters, as well as allowing the user to choose whether or not the criteria for the password generation would include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and/or characters. A set of conditions was also added so that the user will stay within the criteria set forth by the character selections that were confirmed. Coding this application taught me why assigning variables are extremely important, as it defines prompt that you are asking of the code. Also, further understanding the significance of conditional statements was pertinent to the success of this application, because it helps to communicate specifics with the code so that it knows exactly what to do under each circumstance.

## Usage
